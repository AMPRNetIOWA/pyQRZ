==================
pyQRZ
==================
 
A python module to query QRZ.com's ham radio callsign database. 


clone/download this repo, create a settings.cfg file with qrz user/pass (see settings_example.cfg) then see qrz_example.py for a use example. 




.. NOTE:  To use QRZ's XML API, a subscription is required. Visit www.QRZ.com to learn more.  I'll be releasing another ham radio callsign module (USA only) which will use free data from the FCC in the near future.
